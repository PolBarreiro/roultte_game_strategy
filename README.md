Each time you lose you triple the bet and play same color # Each time you win, you restart the bet to one dollar # in theory you always win if you could triple your bet forever # at some point it will always fall on your color # problem is you run out of money due tu incremental bet being triple # so, if you wander, what if I play this strategy un to a certain number? # and play it for many times? # will it add up to positive values or will I loose money? # well, let's find out
